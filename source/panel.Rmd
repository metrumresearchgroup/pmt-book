# Group table rows with panel  {#panel-intro}

## Syntax

To panel a table by `STUDY` 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
stable(stdata(), panel = "STUDY") 
```

To set a prefix for the panel header:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
stable(stdata(), panel = as.panel("STUDY", prefix = "Study: "))
```


## Basics

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = '.')
source("global.R")
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
smcars <- mutate(mtcars, name = rownames(mtcars))
smcars <- select(smcars, name, everything())
smcars <- filter(smcars, cyl < 8)
smcars <- arrange(smcars, carb)
smcars <- slice(smcars, 1:10)
```

Paneling your table is a way to group sets of rows together into a "panel" 
with a panel header rendered in bold font. For example, we can panel a table 
of `mtcars` by `carb`.  We will be working with an abbreviated version of 
`mtcars`:

```{r}
smcars
```

Then we pass into `stable()` and name the paneling column:
```{r}
smcars %>% stable(panel = "carb") %>% st_asis()
```

Now, all of the `carb==1` rows are grouped with the heading `1` and similarly 
the `carb==2` rows are grouped with the heading `2` in bold. 

This is ok, but a more informative heading would be helpful. To do this, we'll 
call `as.panel()` to both name the panel column and set some options:

```{r}
smcars %>% stable(panel = as.panel("carb", prefix = "carb: ")) %>% st_asis()
```

Note that the prefix is completely specified by the user (including any spaces
or a colon).


## panel: additional customization 

See the `?rowpanel` help topic for arguments to `rowpanel()` that can be passed
to customize the panel.  Some of the customizations include

1. add a prefix to the panel title
1. skip making panels for certain data in the panel column
1. make the panel title bold
1. make the panel title italics
1. opt out from drawing `hline` above panels
1. jut the panel titles so that the rows under the panel header are indented
   (available starting with version 0.4.1)

### `jut`

We recommend an value more than 1, otherwise the table looks mis-aligned rather
than creating offset between panel row and underlying data.

```{r}
stable(
  stdata(), 
  panel = as.panel("STUDY", jut = 1)
) %>% st_asis()
```

This feature requires pmtables 0.4.1 or greater.

## panel: important points

1. Most of the time, the data frame should be sorted by the `panel` column
1. pmtables creates panels by non-repeating values in the panel column; there 
   will be an error if duplicate panel names are found and this can be 
   overridden by passing `duplicates_ok` to `as.panel()`.
