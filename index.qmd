<img src=pmt-hex.png align=right width=150px></img>This is a simple 
introduction to the pmtables package for R. I hope this will be useful for 
those who are new to the package and those who just need a  reminder on the 
syntax. 


pmtables turns R data frames into tables for inclusion in a TeX document. Since
the current book is rendered to `html` format, we cannot naturally render the 
table outputs as we work examples. Instead, we process the output table code
in a `pdf` snippet and include it into the `html` document as a `png` file. 
This is accomplished using a new function called `st_as_image()`. The only 
purpose for calling this function is to get the table to appear in the pages
of this book. This function can be useful for previewing tables or having them
appear in `html` documents but it should generally not be used if creating
outputs for TeX reports. You will  find this function in pmtables release 
`0.4.1` and later.


There is also a `pdf` version of this book available 
[here](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/pmt-book/blob/main/pmt-intro.pdf).
