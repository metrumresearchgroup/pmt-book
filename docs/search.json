Since the current book is rendered to html format, we cannot naturally render the table outputs as we work examples. Instead, we process the output table code in a pdf snippet and include it into the html document as a png file. This is accomplished using a new function called st_as_image(). The only purpose for calling this function is to get the table to appear in the pages of this book. This function can be useful for previewing tables or having them appear in html documents but it should generally not be used if creating outputs for TeX reports. You will not find this function in a pmtables release yet; but it will be available for the release after 0.4.1.\nThere is also a pdf version of this book available here.\n\nSource\nThe pmtables package is maintained here.\nThe code for this book is maintained here.\n\n\nBuild\n\npackageVersion(\"pmtables\")\n\n[1] '0.4.1.9003'\n\ndate()\n\n[1] \"Mon May  2 09:11:39 2022\""

That is to say: the output from stable() is a character vector of latex code for the table. Note also that this character vector has a special class associated with it: stable. That means we can write functions that recognize this character vector as output from stable() and we can have those functions process the character vector in special ways.\nWe can render that table in TeX in the current Rmarkdown document by passing the text to st_asis().\n\nout %>% st_as_image() \n\n\n\n\nRemember to only call st_asis() when you are rendering tables inline in an Rmd document. If you are sending table code to a TeX report, then you will save them to a file and then include them into your report.\nThe remaining sections of this chapter will show you how to modify and enhance this output in the more basic ways. We will implement separate chapters for more complicated table manipulations."

    "text": "4.6 Span created by splitting column names\ncolsplit() is a way to create column spanners which are encoded into the column names of the input data frame; the names are split on a separator character (like .) and either the left or right side are taken as the title and the other is taken as the column name.\nConsider this data\n\n\n  A.first A.second B.third B.fourth\n1       1        2       3        4\n\n\nNotice the natural grouping between A.first and A.second; we want first and second grouped together with the title A. Similar setup for third and fourth under the title B.\nWe can make table with spanners by passing a call to colsplit() as span_split\n\nstable(dd, span_split = colsplit(sep = '.')) %>% \n  st_as_image()\n\n\n\n\n\n4.6.1 pivot_longer workflow\nThis is pattern is convenient when summarizing data in a long format. To to demonstrate, we’ll calculate summary statistics for WT and AGE by STUDY\n\nsumm <- \n  pmt_first %>%\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(\"WT\", \"AGE\")) %>% \n  filter(!is.na(value)) %>%\n  group_by(STUDYf, name) %>% \n  summarise(Mean = mean(value), Sd = sd(value), N = n(), .groups = \"drop\") %>%\n  mutate(across(Mean:N, sig)) %>% \n  mutate(across(Mean:N, as.character))\n\nsumm\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 5\n  STUDYf      name  Mean  Sd    N    \n  <fct>       <chr> <chr> <chr> <chr>\n1 12-DEMO-001 AGE   32.0  9.19  30   \n2 12-DEMO-001 WT    72.2  14.3  29   \n3 12-DEMO-002 AGE   35.0  8.20  50   \n4 12-DEMO-002 WT    72.4  11.5  49   \n5 11-DEMO-005 AGE   32.8  8.48  40   \n6 11-DEMO-005 WT    68.9  14.5  39   \n7 13-DEMO-001 AGE   34.2  9.67  40   \n8 13-DEMO-001 WT    69.4  11.6  40   \n\n\nNow take 2 (or 3) more steps to get the table in the right shape to feed into stable(). First, pivot this longer using the summary stat name\n\nlong <- pivot_longer(summ, cols = c(\"Mean\", \"Sd\", \"N\"), names_to = \"stat\")\nhead(long)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  STUDYf      name  stat  value\n  <fct>       <chr> <chr> <chr>\n1 12-DEMO-001 AGE   Mean  32.0 \n2 12-DEMO-001 AGE   Sd    9.19 \n3 12-DEMO-001 AGE   N     30   \n4 12-DEMO-001 WT    Mean  72.2 \n5 12-DEMO-001 WT    Sd    14.3 \n6 12-DEMO-001 WT    N     29   \n\n\nSecond, we’ll make name more appealing / informative\n\nlong <- mutate(\n  long, \n  name = recode(name, WT = \"Weight (kg)\", AGE = \"Age (years)\")\n)\n\nThird, pivot this wider using the covariate name and stat\n\nwide <- pivot_wider(\n  long, \n  names_from = c(\"name\", \"stat\"), \n  names_sep = \"---\"\n)\nwide\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 7\n  STUDYf     `Age (years)--…` `Age (years)--…` `Age (years)--…` `Weight (kg)--…`\n  <fct>      <chr>            <chr>            <chr>            <chr>           \n1 12-DEMO-0… 32.0             9.19             30               72.2            \n2 12-DEMO-0… 35.0             8.20             50               72.4            \n3 11-DEMO-0… 32.8             8.48             40               68.9            \n4 13-DEMO-0… 34.2             9.67             40               69.4            \n# … with 2 more variables: `Weight (kg)---Sd` <chr>, `Weight (kg)---N` <chr>\n\n\nNow we have column names set up to create the spanners\n\nstable(wide, span_split = colsplit(sep = \"---\")) %>% \n  st_as_image()\n\n\n\n\nThis workflow takes several steps to complete, but once you identify the pattern it can be just an extra step or two beyond what you’re already doing to get a nice table."
